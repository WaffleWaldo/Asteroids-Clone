Usage
The game is easy to play. You control a spaceship that can move in any direction and shoot lasers to destroy incoming asteroids. You can use the arrow keys or WASD keys to move the spaceship and the spacebar to shoot lasers. You earn points by destroying asteroids. The game ends when your spaceship is destroyed by an asteroid.

Gameplay
When the game starts, you will see your spaceship in the middle of the screen. The screen is divided into two parts: the top part shows your score and the bottom part shows the game area.

Asteroids will start appearing from the edges of the screen and move towards your spaceship. You can shoot lasers to destroy them by pressing the spacebar. If an asteroid hits your spaceship, you lose a life. You start with three lives and lose one life each time your spaceship is hit.

If you destroy an asteroid, it will break into smaller asteroids that move faster. You earn points for each asteroid you destroy, and the smaller the asteroid, the more points you earn.
